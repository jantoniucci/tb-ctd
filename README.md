# üí∞ Certified Time Deposit with TigerBeetle

This project implements a REST service for the lifecycle of a **Certified Time Deposit (CTD)** using [TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle), a high-performance financial ledger designed for distributed systems. It demonstrates how to model fixed-term deposit products in a double-entry accounting environment.

## üìò What is a Time Deposit?

A **Time Deposit** (or **CTD ‚Äì Certified Time Deposit**) is a financial product where a customer commits to locking funds for a predefined duration ‚Äî the **maturity period** ‚Äî in exchange for a **guaranteed, higher interest rate**. During the term:

- **Funds are non-withdrawable** until maturity.
- **Interest rates are fixed** and higher than those offered by regular savings accounts.
- **Deposits are only accepted** during a limited **deposit period**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Only **positive interest rates** are supported for Time Deposit accounts. Negative rates are not allowed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Run TigerBeetle locally**
   - Follow the instructions in the [official repository](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle) to start a local instance on port `3000`.

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the service**

   ```bash
   java -jar target/*.jar
   ```

4. **Use the embedded [HAL Explorer](https://github.com/toedter/hal-explorer)** 
[Click here](http://localhost:8080/explorer/index.html#uri=/) or run this command:
   ```
   open http://localhost:8080/explorer/index.html#uri=/
   ```
5. **Observability**
The project uses Spring Modulith's observability features to inspect the runtime interaction between the logical modules. To use and see this, run the application with the observability Maven profile enabled:
   ```
   $ mvn spring-boot:run -Pobservability
   ```
   That profile adds some dependencies, like Spring Cloud Sleuth as well as its integration with Zipkin. It also includes docker-compose support and will start Zipkin for you when the application starts. Interactions with the system will now expose the logical module invocation and their choreography.

## üß± Architecture Notes

This project is being designed using **Clean Architecture** principles, enriched with **modular boundaries**, **use-case-driven design**, and **event-driven communication**.

### Core Architectural Layers

* **Domain Layer**
  Defines the core business model and rules (e.g., `Account`, `InterestPolicy`, `MaturitySchedule`). This layer is **pure Java**, without dependencies on frameworks or external libraries. It includes:

  * Value Objects and Entities
  * Domain Services
  * Domain Events (e.g., `AccountMatured`, `DepositCreated`)

* **Application Layer**
  Orchestrates use cases like `OpenAccount`, `MakeDeposit`, `ApplyMaturity`. It coordinates between the domain and infrastructure layers and is responsible for:

  * Input validation
  * Transaction boundaries
  * Publishing domain events
  * Use case orchestration without containing business logic itself

* **Infrastructure Layer**
  Provides technical capabilities to support the domain and application layers. It includes:

  * Adapter for **TigerBeetle Java client**
  * Persistence (if needed for internal states or metadata)
  * Time services, UUID generators, and serialization
  * Event publishing or logging infrastructure

* **Interface Layer** *(Planned)*
  The outermost layer intended for interacting with the application via:

  * CLI interface (initial)
  * REST API (future)
  * Input DTOs and output views for external consumers

* **Modular Boundaries**
  The system is structured around **business capabilities**, separating concerns cleanly into vertical modules (e.g., `accounts`, `deposits`, `maturity`, `renewals`) which each contain their own domain, application logic, and adapters.

* **Domain Events & Event-Driven Flow**
  Domain events like `DepositPeriodClosed` or `AccountRenewed` are used to trigger follow-up processes decoupled from the original command, promoting extensibility and separation of concerns.

* **Aggregate Roots and Invariants**
  Aggregates enforce consistency boundaries, e.g., `Account` as the root of a CDT lifecycle. Invariants like "no deposits after deposit period ends" are enforced within the aggregate.

* **Typed Use Cases**
  Use cases are modeled explicitly, with clear input/output models, avoiding "anemic services." Each use case is isolated and testable in complete separation from infrastructure.

* **Port and Adapter Pattern**
  All dependencies point inward. Interfaces (Ports) are defined in the domain or application layers, while implementations (Adapters) live in the infrastructure layer.

* **Time as a First-Class Concern**
  The concept of time (e.g., for deposit periods, maturity, grace windows) is handled explicitly via injected clock providers, enabling testability and simulation.
